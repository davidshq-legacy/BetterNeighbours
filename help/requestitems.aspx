        </strong></span>
        <span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>A. </strong>Once you have located an item
            you desire there will be a button at the bottom that says "Request Item" if the
            item is available (no one else has requested it). If you click this button you will
            place a request for the item. However, you must have "Pack Rats" available to request
            an item. Each month you are given two free pack rats. You also receive one pack
            rat for every item you offer on BetterNeighbours. This is to help ensure that items
            are being distributed to those who need them, and not just to those of us who have
            problems with aggregating items we don't need. Once you have requested an item you
            will be able to see the status of your request in the "My Requests" section.</span></p>
