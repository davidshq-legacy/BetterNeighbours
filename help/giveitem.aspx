        <span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Q. How Do I Give An Item I've Offered?<br />
            A. </strong>After you have added an item and it has been approved, it will be available
            for people to request. Once a request is made you will receive an email and you
            will have the option to approve or reject the request. In general you should accept
            requests, unless you have a good reason not to. Once you have accepted the person's
            request you will receive an email with their email address as well as being able
            to see it on your "My Offers" page. You should contact them and arrange either a
            time for them to pick up the item or how you will ship it to them. Please remember
            to <a href="safety.aspx">use wisdom and be safe</a>.</span></p>
