                <br />
                A. </strong>Once you have received an item, or if the individual failed to give
                you the item, you can mark the request as completed in the "My Requests" section.
                This will then allow you to click "Leave Feedback" and leave a comment about the
                transaction. Doing so is useful as a way of letting the offerer know how they did
                in the transaction as well as helping others to be aware of what to expect from
                this individual and even to avoid them if need be.</span></p>
