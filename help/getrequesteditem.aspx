        When Do I Get the Requested Item?</h1>
    <p>
        <span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Q. When Do I Get the Item I Requested?</strong></span></p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>A. </strong>If the individual who offered
            the item accepts your request you will receive an automated email with their email
            address. This will allow you to contact them and schedule either a pickup time or
            a method of shipping the item to you. Please read our <a href="safety.aspx">recommendations
                on safety</a> to ensure that you make this transaction as safe as possible.
            You might want to write a short email something like:</span></p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-family: Verdana">Hi (name),<br />
        </span><span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is (name). I just received
            an email saying you accepted my request for (name of item) you were offering. Thanks
            so much! I saw this was a shippable item. Would you be willing to ship it to (address)?
            Would you like me to pay anything for shipping and handling? Thanks again.<br />
            Respectfully,<br />
            (name)</span></p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; We can't tell you when exactly
            you will receive the item. That depends on when you can schedule the pickup or how
            long it takes the postal system to deliver the item. But we hope that you will find
            the transaction quick, easy, and safe.</span></p>
