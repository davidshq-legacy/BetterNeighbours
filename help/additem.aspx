        <strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Q. How can I offer an item?<br />
        </span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>A. </strong>We always welcome
            additions to BetterNeighbours from our users. In fact, that is the reason BetterNeighbours
            exists. Its a give and take website. It will only work if those who receive are
            also willing to give. You can add an item to our site by clicking the "Add Item"
            link on the left-hand side of the site. Then fill out the appropriate information
            about your item, clicking next at the end of each page. At the end you will be prompted
            to "Finish". Once one clicks Finish the item is added to the database where it awaits
            a moderator to approve the item. Once the item is approved it will appear in the
            appropriate areas of the site. You will be emailed when someone requests your item.</span></p>
