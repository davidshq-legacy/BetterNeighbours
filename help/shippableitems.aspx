        &nbsp;&nbsp; What are Shippable Items? Glad you asked. Shippable Items are items
        that people listed that they are willing to ship. With many similar programs the
        only way to receive an item is to pick it up, which limits the items you can receive
        to what the people around you have. At Better Neighbours we allow individuals to
        offer items that they are willing to ship. If you request a shippable item the offerer
        will need your postal address and may request payment for shipping and handling
        costs. If you ever feel that the S&amp;H they are requesting is unreasonable please
        let us know. We want to ensure that the only cost is truly compensation for shipping
        to the offerer.</span>
