        A. </strong>There are several simple ways to find items. The first is to select
        your state and then county from the main page. You can then select to see items
        in a specific category or all items available in your county. One can also click
        on Shippable Items to see all the items that are available to be shipped as well
        as on Wanted Items to see what others have need of.</span>
