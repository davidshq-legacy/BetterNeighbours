    <span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Introduction:<br />
    </strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; Growing up we were always taught, "Don't talk to strangers."
        Doesn't Better Neighbors compromise this ideology by encouraging individuals to
        exchange items, oftentimes in person, with complete strangers? The answer to this
        question is yes and no.<br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; First, we won't get into a diatribe (right now) about how we have
        allowed fear to prevent us from being "better neighbors", rather we will focus on
        how Better Neighbors seeks and encourages you to make this a safe experience.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Built-In Safety:<br />
        </strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; Every user is required to register. This gives some amount
        of accountability. Since users are registered, all exchanges are tracked, and should
        there be any difficulties we won't hesitate to hand all records we have available
        over to the governmental authorities.<br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Secondly, users can leave other users feedback. This will allow users
        to develop a reputation for trustworthy (or untrustworthy behavior).<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Steps You Can Take:</strong><br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Safety doesn't stop with our built-in features, however. In fact,
        these built-in features should never be used as a "catch-all" safety net. Rather
        we strongly encourage you to take the appropriate steps to safeguard yourself and
        your family. This may include:<br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; (a) Making exchanges in public places - such as at a bookstore, in
        a mall, at a church.<br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; (b) Making exchanges with someone else present.<br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; (c) Leave items outside the door, rather than personally presenting
        items.<br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; (d) Telling someone where you are going, or that you plan on meeting
        a Better Neighbor before you do so.<br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; (e) Using a P.O. Box for shippable items.</span>
