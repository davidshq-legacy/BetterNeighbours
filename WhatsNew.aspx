    <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: Verdana">1.50 - 11/25/06 - Added several articles to the
            Help! section, offering much more comprehensive assistance in utilizing the site.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Verdana">1.45 - 11/24/06 - Added the ability to see all
            items in a given county, rather than those in a specific category.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Verdana">1.40 - 11/18/06 - Added the ability to see all
            shippable items.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: Verdana">1.36 - 11/18/06 - On the back-end I added email
            notifications to me when new items are added, allowing me to more quickly approve
            new listings.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Verdana">1.35 - 9/19/06 - Made default zip appear automatically.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: Verdana">1.34 - 9/19/06 - Corrected a problem that caused
            unapproved items to appear on the Shippable Items page.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: Verdana">1.33 - 9/19/06 - Fixed problem with "Set Default"
            button on Add Item page for counties.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: Verdana">1.32 - 9/16/06 - Closed some loopholes that would
            have allowed unethical users to take advantage of the Pack Rats system.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: Verdana">1.30 - 9/13/06 - Refined profile viewing so that
            it was available on Shippable Items and Wanted Items. Added the ability to remove
            an item that was offered. Ensured that all screens showed textual reports rather
            than numeric reports of status.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: Verdana">1.23 - 9/01/06 - Added the concept of "Pack Rats".
            Each user receives 2 pack rats for join and two additional pack rats per month.
            These pack rats can be used to request items. This will help prevent one person
            from collecting large numbers of items. But fear not, one can earn additional pack
            rats by giving away items. Each item given away is worth 1 pack rat. The vision
            is to help ensure that items are being distributed to those who need them and as
            a subtle encouragement to those of us with a pack rat nature to share. :-)</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: Verdana">1.22 - 8/27/06 - Added a profile page that allows
            you to view the feedback of other users. Also made some minor revisions to some
            pages to cleanup their interfaces.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: Verdana">1.20 - 6/24/06 - Added email notifications at
            several points. Both the offerer and receiver now receive notification emails when
            an item is requested, approved, or released. I also added a "select an option" to
            the "My Requests" page so all items weren't automatically released instead of just
            selected ones.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: Verdana">1.13 - 6/15/06 - Corrected several problems relating
            to the way status of items was displayed and corrected the Request Item mechanism.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: Verdana">1.12 - 6/11/06 - Fixed several problems programmatically

            to category item results pages.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: Verdana">1.10 - 6/11/06 - Removed blank spaces from drop
            down list of states on main page. Added a wanted items page as well as the ability

            <li><span style="font-family: Verdana">1.06 - 6/10/06 - Made it so categories and counties
