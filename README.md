# Introduction
BetterNeighbours was built out of my admiration for and frustrations with FreeCycle way back in 2006. It provided a number of feature enhancements over what FreeCycle had at the time (and some that FreeCycle still doesn't have!). I no longer run the site nor work with this code, so I'm making it available here primarily for historical reasons, but feel free to play around with it if you like. It uses ASP.NET, VB.NET, Web Forms, with a MSSQL DB.

# Features
* Ability to set default categories, counties, and zip codes on add item page.
* Ability to offer items but also to request items.
* Email notifications.
* Profile page for users, includes feedback on transactions with user from other users.
* Pack rat concept which helped prevent a single individual from taking massive numbers of items.
* Ability to offer items not just locally but also as shippable.
* A lot of other stuff I don't remember. :)

# Version
It appears my first release (1.00) June 9th, 2016. The last was 1.50 on November 25th, 2006.
